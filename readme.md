checking something

This project create anki cards for studying the paramedic (Hovshim) course.

## prerequisites
1. Install Anki desktop
1. If you don't have id in anki, add your id (the id is your email). You should signup/login with your id (email) and password.
2. Add to Anki the add-on `AnkiConnect`.
   3. Open Anki program
   4. Click on Tools->Add-ons
   5. Click on `Get add-ons`
   6. Write the code `2055492159`
3. This code works with python 3.10 (it worked both in Windows and Linux). It doesn't work with python 3.7 nor 3.8 (I checked).

Before you run the script, you MUST open ANKI program.  
Otherwise, the script will fail to connect with ANKI.
